I am not making an excuse. I am just telling you what happened. I had to submit
my project late because I could not get it to compile for the longest time. Only after
you fixed it on my laptop was I able to start working on this project, but that was 2 days
before it was due. I had tried to work on it earlier, but I couln't get anything done until
I could get it to compile. I just want you to know that I really put in an effort to do this
earlier, but because of the compile issues and my work schedule, I have to turn it in a day
late. I hope you can understand. Thanks.
